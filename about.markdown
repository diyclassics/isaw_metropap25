The first New York Metro Papyrology Workshop was held at ISAW in December 2022 as a forum for papyrologists, librarians, conservators, and others who have papyrological projects to share recent work and updates about projects. It also was meant to help connect graduate students and others new to papyrology to more established professionals working the metro region, extending the spirit of [<i>amicitia papyrologorum</i>](https://aip.ulb.be/amicitia.html).   

The workshop was inspired by the papyrologial seminar that [Prof. Roger S. Bagnall](https://isaw.nyu.edu/people/faculty/emeritus-faculty/rbagnall), the first Leon Levy Director of ISAW, hosted in his apartment in New York for thirty years.
